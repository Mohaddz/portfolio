Hello! I'm Mohammed Alnamri, a recent Computer Science graduate from King Abdulaziz University (KAU).

My passion lies at the intersection of cutting-edge AI technologies. I'm particularly fascinated by **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **Computer Vision (CV)**, and the power of data â€“ especially in large volumes! I thrive on transforming complex datasets into actionable insights and intelligent solutions.

Throughout my studies and personal projects, I've had the opportunity to dive deep into these areas. Some of my notable projects include:

*   **Vision+**: Led a project focused on denoising low-dose CT scans in medical imaging using Computer Vision techniques. The goal was to enhance image quality for better diagnostics while minimizing patient radiation exposure.
*   **WarshaNET**: Developed an AI-driven car damage assessment tool designed to assist insurance companies. This project utilized CV to automate and streamline the initial damage evaluation process.
*   **LLM Exploration**: Gained hands-on experience in continuing the pre-training and fine-tuning of several prominent LLMs, including **ALLaM, Qwen, and Llama**. This involved adapting these models for specific tasks and exploring their diverse capabilities.

I'm a quick learner and always eager to take on new challenges. Let's connect and explore how we can collaborate to make a positive impact in the field of AI!
