During my studies in Computer Science at King Abdulaziz University (KAU), I led a capstone project with my teammates Muhanna Al-Muhanna and Osama Abdulaziz Al-Dosari. Together, we built **Vision+**, an **AI-powered DICOM viewer** that enhances low-dose CT scans, aiming to improve image clarity and assist radiologists in making more accurate diagnoses.

## The Problem: Low-Dose CT Scans and Image Noise

CT scans are essential for diagnosis, but reducing radiation exposure (using Low-Dose CT) often leads to noisy, lower-quality images. This noise can obscure critical details, making diagnosis more difficult. Our goal was to enhance these low-dose images without increasing radiation, helping doctors get the best of both worlds: safer scans and clearer results.

## Our Solution: AI-Enhanced DICOM Viewer

We created a smart, web-based DICOM viewer that automatically denoises low-dose CT images using AI. At its core is a **Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN)** trained to transform noisy images into clearer ones.

### How the AI Works

We used a cGAN architecture composed of two neural networks:

* **Generator (U-Net-based):** Takes a noisy CT scan and produces a cleaned-up version.

* **Discriminator (PatchGAN):** Tries to distinguish real high-quality images from those generated by the model.

By training both networks together, the generator learned to produce realistic, denoised images that closely resemble normal-dose scans.

### Dataset

We trained our model using the [**2016 NIH-AAPM-Mayo Clinic Low Dose CT Grand Challenge**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nih-aapm-mayo-clinic-low-dose-ct-grand-challenge) dataset, which includes both full-dose and simulated quarter-dose CT scans for 10 anonymous patients. The model learned to map noisy images to their clear counterparts using this paired data.

## The Application: Web-Based Viewer

We built a full-stack application to make our AI accessible and user-friendly for medical professionals:

* **Frontend:** Developed in **ReactJS** using **CornerstoneJS** for interactive DICOM rendering.
* **Backend & AI:** The denoising model was implemented in **Python** with **TensorFlow** and deployed on a server to handle inference.

## Results

### Clearer Images, Better Diagnostics

The AI-enhanced scans were significantly sharper than the originals. Key diagnostic features—like tumors in liver scans—became easier to detect after denoising.

### Quantitative Performance

* **PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio):** Improved from \~22.68 to **40.41**
* **SSIM (Structural Similarity Index):** Reached **92.5%**, indicating strong structural preservation

These metrics confirm the model's ability to reduce noise while maintaining important image details.

## Why It Matters

Vision+ has the potential to:

* **Improve patient safety** by supporting lower radiation protocols
* **Support radiologists** with clearer visuals and improved workflow
* **Enable earlier detection** of subtle conditions
* **Lay the groundwork** for future AI-assisted diagnosis tools

## What’s Next

This project was a solid proof-of-concept with plenty of room to grow. Possible next steps include:

* **Adding features like automatic segmentation and tumor detection**
* **Improving the model** with newer architectures and larger datasets

Working on this project reinforced my passion for using AI in healthcare and gave me practical experience building a real-world, AI-powered tool. I’m excited to keep building on this foundation.
